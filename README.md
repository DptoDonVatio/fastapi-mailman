Fastapi-Mailman is a Fastapi extension providing simple email sending capabilities. It's actually a hard fork of `waynerv's` `flask-mailman` module. I have tried to implement the same features for the `Fastapi` too.

It was meant to replace the basic Fastapi-Mail with a better warranty and more features.

## Usage

Fastapi-Mail ported Django's email implementation to your Fastapi applications, which may be the best mail sending implementation that's available for python.

The way of using this extension is almost the same as Django.
